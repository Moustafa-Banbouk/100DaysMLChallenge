# 100 Days Of Machine Learning Challenge - LOG

## Day 1 : Sep 15, 2018

**Today's Progress** : It's time to start my #100DaysOfMLCode challenge by reviewing my Udacity ML Nanodegree course, I started with a revision of stats related concepts with a recap on ML's evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, regression metric, bias, variance, learning curves, complexity curves.

**Thoughts** : I need to perform some hands-on Python exercises

## Day 2 : Sep 16, 2018

**Today's Progress** : From Udacity's ML Nanodegree, Reviewed Supervised Learning Algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees

**Thoughts** : Progress is great

## Day 3 : Sep 17, 2018

**Today's Progress** : From Udacity's ML Nanodegree, SVM, KNN and Ensemble Learners.

**Thoughts** : Progress is great

## Day 4 : Sep 18, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I just reached Day 4 of my #100DaysOfMLCode and had a revision of Udacity's ML Naive Bayes Supervised Learning technique. A great way to detect SPAM and play with Natural Language Processing.

**Thoughts** : Probability refreshing is required

## Day 5 : Sep 22, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Read about AI Planning and in particular G.O.A.P. Algorithm that was used successfully in F.E.A.R 

**Link of Work** : https://aiandgames.com/facing-your-fear/

**Thoughts** : A simple yet effictive AI planning algorithm 

## Day 6 : Sep 23, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Continue reading about AI Planning and in particular G.O.A.P. Algorithm that was used successfully in F.E.A.R "https://aiandgames.com/facing-your-fear/ …". 

**Thoughts** : NA

## Day 7 : Sep 24, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Playing with the some ML Hello World #Python code from "https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/ …"

**Thoughts** : NA

## Day 8 : Sep 25, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Continue playing with the some ML Hello World #Python code from "https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/ …"

**Thoughts** : Great python code to start coding from scratch

## Day 9 : Sep 27, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Explored the iris dataset and built basic ML classifiers using Sci-kit

**Thoughts** : An easy to use dataset

## Day 10 : Sep 28, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Read chapter 1 of Python ML Book, a great refreshing overview

**Thoughts** : Great book to have as a reference

## Day 11 : Sep 29, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started practicing on building a neural net from scratch

**Thoughts** : NA

## Day 12 : Sep 30, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Continue reading chapter one of #PythonMachineLearning Book and discovering the difference between Perceptron Model and Adaptive linear neurons
Book Link: https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-Sebastian-Raschka/dp/1783555130 …

**Thoughts** : Looking forward to refresh my memory for gradient descent
